# A genre should be initialized with a name and an empty @songs array.
# The Genre class needs an instance method, #add_song, that takes in an argument of a song and adds that song to the genre's collection of songs. Now you can use the Genre#add_song method in the Song class' initialize method to tell the genre that it owns the given song.
# The Genre class needs an instance method, #songs, that returns the @songs array.
# The Genre class needs an instance method, #artists, that iterates over the genre's collection of songs and collects the artist that owns each song.
