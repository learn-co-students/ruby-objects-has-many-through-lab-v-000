# A doctor should be initialized with a name and an empty @appointments array.
# The Doctor class needs an instance method, #add_appointment, that takes in an instance of the Appointment class and adds that appointment to the doctor's @appointments array. The method should also tell that appointment that it belongs to that doctor.
# The Doctor class needs an instance method, #appointments, that returns the @appointments array.
# The Doctor class needs an instance method, #patients, that iterates over that doctor's appointments and collects the patient that belongs to each appointment.
